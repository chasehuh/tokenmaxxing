/**
 * OWNER-APPROVED sibling reconcile (option b 2026-07-20, widened to ALL
 * non-live siblings by the in-session owner ruling later that day): codex
 * cannot hot-swap, so a pool swap respawns only the deciding session -
 * siblings keep running whatever account they started on, cannot refresh it
 * cross-account, and would wedge at token expiry. The deciding actor
 * therefore SIGNALS every pooled non-live supervisor cross-session: a
 * reconcile marker addressed by supervisorId (presence filenames carry it).
 * The signal is a marker, never a kill: the only safe respawn point is the
 * sibling's own turn boundary, so its Stop hook promotes the marker into a
 * respawn marker there, adding the session id its stdin alone knows. No
 * respawn-cost margin applies - the alternative to a respawn is a guaranteed
 * eventual wedge - and no signal is ever sent while the LIVE seat is itself
 * unusable (the no-depleted-pre-park analog: never move a session onto a
 * blocked account). Orphaned markers (their supervisor exited before
 * promoting) are garbage-collected here. Idempotent per supervisor: an
 * existing marker is left alone.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO self-exclusion (bugbot/pullfrog/cubic review
 * catches, PR #34): a session whose presence names a non-live account IS the
 * stranded sibling even inside its own hook - its "normal decision" evaluates
 * only the live seat and would never rescue it. A signal the sweep writes for
 * the calling session is consumed by the promote pass its own hook runs right
 * after the evaluation, same boundary. The deciding session that just swapped
 * away leaves a self-addressed signal behind too; the promote staleness guard
 * (presence rewritten at respawn) drops it as moot.
