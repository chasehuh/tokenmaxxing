// Shared switch decision used by the Stop/SessionStart hooks and the periodic
// `check` timer. Cheap pre-check off the lock; the authoritative re-check + swap
// under the flock.
//
// The decision ENGAGES (user policy 2026-07-16) once the active account's 5h
// session window reaches policy.greedySessionFloor, or once any screening bar
// is crossed. Engaged-but-under-every-bar runs the same greedy pace-pressure
// convergence as bare `xx switch` (swap only onto a STRICTLY better usable
// account, current keeps its seat on ties, never a depleted pre-park); over a
// bar keeps the original hard semantics (swap or depleted-wait).
//
// The windows feeding that, all metered against the CURRENTLY-active org:
//   1. AGGREGATE windows (session=five_hour, week-all=seven_day). A rendering
//      statusLine tees them fresh every turn; when nothing renders (headless
//      boxes, idle TUIs) they come from `claude -p '/usage'`, re-probed once the
//      snapshot ages past the poll TTL so they can never freeze at a stale value.
//   2. PER-MODEL weekly cap (e.g. "week (Fable)") - when the active model is
//      capacity-constrained (config policy.switchModels), or for EVERY configured
//      family when the model is unknown (nothing rendered within the TTL, so the
//      session that stamped the last model may be gone).
//
// The org guard is load-bearing: right after a respawn, usage.json still reflects
// the OLD account, so org != activeOrg → we correctly do nothing until fresh usage
// for the new account arrives.
